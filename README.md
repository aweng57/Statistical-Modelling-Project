# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
- The goal of this project is to use three different APIs to collect informtions about surrounding environments. 

## Process
- STEP ONE : I chose the city of London, UK. I retrieved all the available bike stations in that city which is 799 and together I collected the latitude, longitude and number of bikes. 
- STEP TWO : I used two APIs from Foursquare and Yelp to help me retrieve the nearby restaurants and POIs. 
STEP THREE: I compared the venues I gathered from Foursquare and Yelp and decided to sue the venues from YELP.

## Future Goals
Acquire more detailed venues in the future
